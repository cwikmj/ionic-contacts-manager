### Project features

This is a complete ready-to-go template for an Ionic App with many solutions already included in the project, thus making it a great starting point for a larger project. The project is intended for mobile-view layout.

* uses browsers LocalStorage to temporarily store data
* forms validation to ensure correct input, otherwise buttons stay inactive
* custom login page as a default view (no real credentals needed - just ones passing input validation)
* adds one random contact after login by the hidden contacts generator!
* totally 5 views (login, contacts list, add contact, edit contact, page not found)
* adding contact generates a random ID (makes sure ID repetitions won't occur!)
* contacts list sorts them by name
* modal confirming deletion
* custom Alert Service added
* custom Loader Service added
* custom logo designed for better user-experience
* 404 path covered!
* pleasant custom styling theme added
